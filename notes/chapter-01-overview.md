# Chapter 1: Overview of AI Engineering
This has led to the
emergence of model as a service: models developed by these few organizations are
made available for others to use as a service. Anyone who wishes to leverage AI to
build applications can now use these models to do so without having to invest up
front in building a model.
In short, the demand for AI applications has increased while the barrier to entry for
building AI applications has decreased. This has turned AI engineering—the process
of building applications on top of readily available models—into one of the fastest-
growing engineering disciplines.
## The rise of AI engineering

### Language models

A language model encodes statistical information about one or more languages. Intui‐
tively, this information tells us how likely a word is to appear in a given context. For
example, given the context “My favorite color is __”, a language model that encodes
English should predict “blue” more often than “car”.

The basic unit of a language model is token. A token can be a character, a word, or a
part of a word (like -tion), depending on the model.2 For example, GPT-4, a model
behind ChatGPT, breaks the phrase “I can’t wait to build AI applications” into nine
tokens, as shown in Figure 1-1. Note that in this example, the word “can’t” is broken
into two tokens, can and ’t. You can see how different OpenAI models tokenize text
on the OpenAI website.
